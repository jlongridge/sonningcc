<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;big&gt;Serious Cricket will be holding their annual roadshow at the Club on Friday 18th May 2018. Last season was very popular so please arrive early – doors open at 5.30pm.&lt;/big&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are very pleased to confirm that the Colt’s shirt sponsor has renewed for this season, Simple Recruitment Services – a leading independent recruitment company specialising in Sales, Marketing, Industrial, Insurance, Catering and Technical areas: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to supporting cricket activities, SRS and the Club have agreed that junior shirts will be subsidised this year and we hope that all players competing in the Berkshire Youth Cricket League (U9 and above) will purchase the shirt. These are available for the subsidised price of £16 instead of the regular price of £23.  Apply the discount code sonningcc2018 at the checkout. Please make sure you select the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://seriouscricket.co.uk/teamwear/stores/sonning-cricket-club/1manm59g/"&gt;junior shirt, with the "SRS" logo&lt;/a&gt; .</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please note that if you decide to purchase then the commercial relationship is between you and Serious Cricket and we cannot intervene. However, we are interested in your feedback on the quality of product and service that you receive from Serious Cricket as we keep this relationship under regular review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are a traditional cricket club and prefer your children to wear predominantly white clothing for matches and training. We do not require you to purchase Club clothing although, in practice, most of the children that are U9 or older wear club-badged shirts for matches in the Berkshire Youth Cricket League.</span></p>
