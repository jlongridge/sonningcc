<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are lucky to have a wealth of cricketing facilities in our local area that the Colts can use:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;ul&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;King George's Field, Pound Lane, Sonning - the home of Sonning Cricket Club&lt;/li&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;King George’s Field - Sonning&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">King George’s field is the club’s main ground and is the location of the Club House.  It is located next to Sonning C of E Primary school.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Approaching from the A4 turn into Pound Lane at the Woodley/Sonning roundabout towards Sonning village. After approximately 250 yards you will reach a zebra crossing – turn left immediately after this crossing, into Ligugé Way. The car park for King George’s field is immediately on the right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
