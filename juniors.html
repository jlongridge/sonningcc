<h1 align="center">Sonning and Charvil Junior Cricket Club</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
The junior section (aka the Colts) at Sonning and Charvil was established in 2007 by Nick Ray who now serves the club as Junior Cricket Manager.  The Colts offers cricket to boys and girls of all abilities from age 5 up to 15.

Our aim is to promote cricket for all in a friendly and enjoyable environment where all children have an opportunity to take part in the game of cricket and develop new skills irrespective of their starting ability. In the medium term, we plan to produce a constant stream of new talent for the senior sides at the club. Around 15 of our Colts have already made their debuts for the senior sides and this season we have 10 boys and 2 girls playing representative cricket for Berkshire across the age groups.

We are delighted to announce the appointment of our new professional coach, Jason Pennisi, who will be taking an active role in the development of our Colts as Head Coach during the 2018 season.  Jason is a first team playing member at the club, averaging 60 last season and is a useful spin bowler and outstanding fielder.  Jason is a teacher and lead cricket coach at the Oratory School and a member of the Berkshire County coaching team. He has previously played in Australia for Queensland Country districts and has been a member of the Queensland Academy of Sport emerging players programme. Jason is an accredited Sports Scientist with a specialisation in sports-specific conditioning. He was recently the overseas player for Windsor CC and was the Master in charge of Cricket at St John’s Beaumont Preparatory School. Jason will also be assisted by coaches from Beaumont Academy and other county-standard coaches.  Jason's team will be present at all indoor and Friday night outdoor training sessions continuing our efforts to improve the quality of coaching that we will offer for all our young players supporting our existing helpers and qualified ECB coaches.

We run Sunday morning training sessions for the Under 7s at Blue Coats School from May onwards.  The U9s and above take part in both winter and summer coaching sessions as well as playing friendly and league matches in the Berkshire Youth Cricket League.  We currently have teams registered in the U9, U11, U13 and U15 divisions.  In addition, Colts older than 13 are frequently offered the opportunity to play in our adult sides, including out mid-week Twenty20 side.

We have held the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecb.co.uk/be-involved/club-support/clubmark">ECB Clubmark</a> status since 2012, as testimony to our determination to run a professional operation even though we are entirely volunteer-run with all funds being used to support the cricket.

We are particularly keen to find parents with an active interest in cricket who would like to lead a team because as we increase the number of children we have (130 as of 2017) we need more managers to run the sides! You do not need to be a qualified coach, a current or former club cricketer with some enthusiasm would be perfect. However, if you wish to qualify as a coach we would try to give you financial support.  We are also looking to expand the management committee and the coaching/ parental roster and anyone with an interest in cricket would be welcomed with open arms. Please email <a href="mailto:scjcricket@ntlworld.com">scjcricket@ntlworld.com</a> or call Nick Ray on 07989 606102 to discuss further.
